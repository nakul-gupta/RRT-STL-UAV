# RRT-STL-UAV

The goal of this project is to implement an RRT motion planning algorithm for a quadrotor uav traversing a cityscape. We are using signal-temporal-logic as additioanl constraints on our algorithm to see if this improves performance or robustness, relative to out-of-the-box algorithms provided by Mathworks.
